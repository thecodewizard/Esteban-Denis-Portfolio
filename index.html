        <h2>Me, Myself and I</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Hey All,</p>
            <p>I'm Esteban Denis, as you might have guessed by the big title up there.
            <br/><br/>
            Not only am I incredibly funny and witty but I'm also known for my creativity and enthusiasm, two virtues that - according to me - nobody can have enough of. Thinking out of the box? <br/> I'm not even IN the box.
                <br/><br/>
                I'll keep this short and summarize myself: I cannot keep things short, I'll always go the - literary - extra mile and tend not to quit once I have started something.
                My drive consists of enthusiasm and inquisitiveness. I'm that kind of person that converts positive reinforcement to results - I need my pats on the back - and I have a big love for presenting, social interaction and travelling.
                When you need someone that is brutally honest - I was born without a firewall - and never can stop making witty jokes, you've found your guy. Or at least that guy's website...
                <br/><br/>
                But enough about me, here is more about who I am: Scroll through to see something about my history, something about my future, a little word on my internship and a peek in my skill sets.
                And if you were here to just download my CV, do not fear, the button is right here! But I do urge you to scroll a bit further. You did already load the webpage soooo...

                                    With this software, we could communicate with a PCB all over the world and turn off our lights and manage our heating.<br/>
                                    Special is its design, as this was fully written with the modular MVVM design pattern, which really improved flexibility across devices</p>

                                In order to make the life easier for my parents, I made a shopping app. Do not judge, as this was one of my first programs ever made, but I think it has its charms.</p>

                                <p>After 2 months in NMCT, I wanted to use my newly gained programming skills to make games and other stuff I considered cool at that time and age.<br/>
                                This was made for NMCT during their visitation days, and it's a little game. The code itself is terrible, after only 2 months you cannot code that well,
                                    but it still has some fun aspects as a game.</p>

                                and notifies you when something goes offline. <br/>
                                This is based on master-slave principle. Remote slave scripts are gathering pings and reporting to a master node in the cloud.</p>

                                <p>For my 2<sup>nd</sup> year of NMCT I had been tasked to make a site that used a couple of API's. I decided to use the API's of google maps, package distributors and NSlookup servers
                                to create a site that simulated how your TCP/IP packet would go to the server by other means than internet. <br/>
                                If you ever wondered how slow your computer would be if TCP/IP went by postal pidgeons? Find out here.<br/>
                                Note: Some API's are offline so this website might not respond as originally intended.</p>

                                This site should keep track of all the expenses and treasures of a hero. This was my first real backend experience after Wheatley Homesite.</p>

                                    and notifies you when something goes offline. <br/>
                                    This is based on master-slave principle. Remote slave scripts are gathering pings and reporting to a master node in the cloud.</p>

                                <p>For my 2<sup>nd</sup> year of NMCT I had been tasked to make a site that used a couple of API's. I decided to use the API's of google maps, package distributors and NSlookup servers
                                    to create a site that simulated how your TCP/IP packet would go to the server by other means than internet. <br/>
                                    If you ever wondered how slow your computer would be if TCP/IP went by postal pidgeons? Find out here.<br/>
                                    Note: Some API's are offline so this website might not respond as originally intended.</p>

                                <p>My very first and only android application. In the time, Pokémon Go was just announced (and not there yet) so I decided to be quicker.<br/>
                                I made an app that would use Google Maps API to get your map and location, and would use the PokéAPI to get images from pokémon. These images were downloaded from
                                a remote server, but the app is equipped with caching logic. I would asynchronously generate, spawn and countdown pokémons for you to catch. Download your API here.

                    <p>A faraway trip but also faraway friends. I mada a lot of intercultural connections and learned a lot of the ways of other people,
                    with another background, another way of looking at life. Each of these friends enriched me into becoming the human I am today.</p>

                    <p>No matter how far I'll go, people will always know me as that enthusiastic computer geek who came and stole the show. <br/>
                        I enjoyed my life to the fullest. Do you?</p>

                    <p>I cannot mention my internship to India without showing you the most touristic photograph ever. An amazing building visited on an almost equally amazing trip. Thanks Sergio for the good company.</p>

                    <p>"Is it possib...?" YES! In India, everything is possible. And so is riding around on a camel. In Jaiselmer we went on a 3-day safari, survived in the desert,
                    managed water supplies, made fire from dried savanna wood and cooked our own meals! This gave me the awesomest thrill - Going back to basic!</p>

                    <p>Ah the Holi Festival, maybe the greatest national festival I have ever encountered! On Holi, whole india buys paint and throws it on each other, no matter race, stance, class or anything.
                    I threw paint on cows, cops, friends, teachers and hotelowners as they would give me as much from their share as they could.<br/>
                    There is a saying; Holi is the only festival that you don't have. Holi is meant to be played.</p>

                    <p>Rishikesh was literal heaven on earth. Being the spritual center of India this place was the epicentrum of inner peace, calm and relaxation.<br/>
                    If you ever want to forget your stress and day to day rituals, go to rishikesh and find... yourself.</p>

            <p>My experiences in India changed me and thought me a lot. I am not longer limited to the western ways of handling things. <br/>
            They learned me that nothing is really a problem if you have a no-bullshit hands on attitude. Even the people in the poorest slumbs
            lived happy from one day to the other, enjoying the gift of life without worrying. A wonderful and rich experience, which I will live by for the rest of my life.</p>

        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>What are my aspirations for the future? What would be my ideal job? Fact is, I'm a super flexible guy with many interests, so it's hard to define a specific job that would describe my needs.
        <br/>But this would be a very boring section if I only glossed over how multi-employable I am. Let's sum up some core concepts that I really require in a possible job:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Challenging</li>
            <li>Diversifying</li>
            <li>Sociable</li>
            <li>Upgradable</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Challenging</h3>
            <p>I need the challenge. An easy stay-at-home 9 to 5 is not on my wishlist. I'm a fighter and want to grow and be challenged by my job.
            Don't worry, if you give me a task that I don't know how to do yet, it won't be for long. Lifelong learning is a virtue.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>Diversifying</h3>
            <p>My biggest fear is to grow old behind the same desk. This does not imply that I'm in for some job hopping but the job that I have
            should offer me adventure, should be diversifying. I've got a lot of flexibility and enthusiasm to give, but I need something to give it to.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Sociable</h3>
            <p>According to people around me, I've always been the talker. I enjoy giving presentations and speaking to/in front of people gives me the thrill that I so crave.<br/>
            The perfect job for me combines my IT Knowledge and my predestined love for presenting.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Upgradable</h3>
            <p>My enthusiasm, professionalism and knowledge are bundled into a strong and powerful working force. However, that force needs a goal. I need something to strive for, must mark the red X on the map.
            <br/>Having a goal in live eases me and as long as my future job provides me with something to work up to, I can channel that beam of productivity.</p>
